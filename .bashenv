# .bashenv is invoked by all interactive non-csh-style shells via
# .profile, and hopefully all non-interactive shells too, but don't
# bet on the latter; it depends on whether ENV or BASH_ENV were set,
# and the version of bash.  ~/.ssh/environment can set it if ssh is
# involved.  As a result, assume the lowest common denominator, e.g.
# old ksh's don't even support ~ expansion, or 'source' (use '.' 
# instead).
