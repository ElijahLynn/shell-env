# Adam's UNIX shell environment

This is my collection of UNIX shell configuration files and utilities.
These days I only use them with zsh and bash on Linux, but in the
past I also used them on various Solaris and FreeBSD machines, and
for the most part they should work on any POSIX-oriented UNIX.

## Contents

* Configuration files for zsh
    * `.zshrc` - config for interactive instances only
    * `.zshenv` - config for non-interactive *and* interactive instances
    * `.zsh/` hierarchy, including:
        * `.zsh/functions/` - various handy interactive and completion functions
        * `.zsh/accounts.d/` - for configuring completion of (user, host) pairs
        * `.zsh/users.d/` - for configuring completion of users

* Configuration files for bash
    * `.bashrc` - config for interactive instances only
    * `.bash_profile` - config for interactive "login shell" instances only
    * `.bashenv` - config for non-interactive *and* interactive instances

* Configuration files to be shared by any Bourne-compatible shell
    * `.shared_env` - config for non-interactive *and* interactive instances
    * `.shared_rc` - config for interactive instances only

* Mechanism for automatically switching between shells. <br/>
  Useful for when you do not have root privileges and want to run a
  locally compiled version of `zsh` rather than a system-wide shell.
  See:
    * `.switch_shell`
    * `.ns`

* Perl library `lib/perl5/Sh.pm` providing some handy native Perl
  replacements for shell-like operations.

* Hook-runner mechanism for building composite configuration out of
  multiple files in a `foo.d/` hierarchy.  For more information see:
    * `doc/ConfigHooks.org`
    * `.zsh/functions/find_hooks` - find applicable hook files 
      underneath `foo.d/` hierarchy
    * `.zsh/functions/run_hooks` - run hook files found by `find_hooks`, 
      assuming that they contain shell code
    * `lib/libhooks.sh` - concatenate hook files found by `find_hooks` into 
      a single configuration file which can then be consumed by an external
      program such as `ssh`, `mutt`, `crontab` etc.

* Configuration files for various commonly used UNIX utilities and libraries:
    * `less`
    * `rsync`
    * `ls`

      command run under the `age-track` wrapper.
