Error: cp-merge has been removed.  Consider using rsync with 
the following options instead:

 -R, --relative              use relative path names
 -u, --update                skip files that are newer on the receiver
     --existing              skip creating new files on receiver
     --ignore-existing       skip updating files that already exist on receiver
     --link-dest=DIR         hardlink to files in DIR when unchanged

If hard-linking is required between sources and destination, set
DIR to `pwd` (rsync treats as relative to rsync destination path).
