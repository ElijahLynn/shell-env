#autoload

# NOTE!  This file not only gets used by zsh, but by
# .shared_env, and so has to work when source'd from
# any sh-compatible shell.  Well, any sensible sh.

# Example usage:
#
#   run_hooks .shared_env
#
# would be the last thing executed by ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.shared_env,
# and would check for files (in this order):
#
#   * $ZDOTDIR/.shared_env.d/*
#   * $HOME/.shared_env.d/*
#
# i.e. from least specific to most specific.
#
# Ditto for .zshrc, .bashrc etc.
#
# Additionally, if a filename has one of the following formats,
# it is treated specially:
#
#   * person-$individual_uuid
#   
#     Only run if $individual_uuid equals $ZDOTUSER.  This should
#     be unique to a person (*not* a uid); e-mail addresses are
#     recommended, similar in idea to GNU arch's global archive
#     namespace.
#     
#   * host-$hostname
#
#     Only run if $hostname equals the current hostname.  If there
#     is ambiguity with regards to FQDN or non-FQDN, the code gives
#     the benefit of the doubt in favour of a match.
#
#   * uid-$username
#
#     Only run if $username equals the current (non-numeric) uid.
#     An additional special case: if $username equals 'OWNER', the
#     hook is only run if the current user owns the hook file.
#     This allows uid-specific hooks to be installed in multiple
#     home directories independently of their filename.

# Requirements and rationale for search algorithm:
#
#  * Must allow me to share config with friends.  Accomplished by setting
#    ZDOTDIR to point to my home directory when running as another uid.
#    (We use the parameter name 'ZDOTDIR' because zsh supports it natively
#    when looking for core start-up files, defaulting to $HOME if it's not
#    set.  But we extend the usage of the ZDOTDIR concept via this file
#    to include our own non-core start-up files such as .shared_env.)
#
#  * When others use my config, their environment must not be polluted
#    with stuff specific to me.  Accomplished by keeping all personal
#    stuff in the .${dotfile}.d/person-$ZDOTUSER namespace, where
#    $ZDOTUSER is something globally unique like the individual's
#    email address.  (Although in my case, 'aspiers' is almost
#    certainly "unique enough" for practical purposes, if that
#    expression's not too much of an oxymoron.)
#
#  * Must allow me to switch uid and still use config.  Accomplished by
#    setting ZDOTDIR=~aspiers and ZDOTUSER to my chosen individual UUID
#    value.
#
#  * Must allow per-uid config which would potentially span machines if home
#    directories are shared (e.g. on NFS).  It makes obvious sense to put any
#    per-uid config in the uid's home directory.  This is what the
#    ".${dotfile}.d/uid-OWNER" syntax is for.
# 
#  * Inheritance should be used wherever possible, i.e. ensuring that more
#    settings for specific contexts can override less specific contexts by
#    being loaded later.  [Eh?  You don't need inheritance for that ...]
#
# Other considerations:
#
#  * Current search order doesn't allow specific contexts to override
#    decisions made in less specific contexts without coupling more specific
#    contexts to knowledge of the consequences of those decisions (i.e.
#    you have to know what effects to manually reverse).
#
#  * Finer granularity (more, smaller files) allows easier overriding
#    in specific contexts which solves above issue and makes other
#    things better e.g. setting users/hosts to complete.  This could be
#    prohibitively slow over NFS, but we'll cross that bridge when we come
#    to it, e.g. via some kind of prior compilation into one big .zwc ?
#
#  * Would be nice to provide user with list of things which can be overridden.
#    This can be achieved simply by grepping for run_hooks invocations.
#
#  * Need to support find_hooks for emacs and other non-shell-based
#    environments which invoke the hooks in a different way.#    
#  
#  * ZDOTDIR=~aspiers as root, where ~aspiers is shared via NFS,
#    reduces root privilege a lot since trust level for NFS write
#    access to ~aspiers is only by anyone who can get a port < 1024.
